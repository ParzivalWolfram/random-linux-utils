# random-linux-utils
A repo full of random Linux scripts I've written for myself. Maybe others will get use out of them?



So far we have the following:



update: Quickly update and power off/reboot your machine after on Debian-based machines. Currently tries to trim /home and /, then powers off. Edit to liking.

makesum: Run md5sum, sha1sum, sha256sum, sha512sum, and crc32 on a given subdirectory recursively. (Doesn't handle absolute paths properly.)

switch: Alias to quickly change which package provides a binary.



More to come, eventually. Maybe.
