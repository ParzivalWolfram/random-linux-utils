# random-linux-utils
A repo full of random Linux scripts I've written for myself. Maybe others will get use out of them?

So far we have the following:

update: Quickly update and power off/reboot your machine after on Debian-based machines.
makesum: Run md5sum, sha1sum, sha256sum, sha512sum, and crc32 on a subdirectory recursively. (Doesn't handle absolute paths properly.)

More to come, eventually. Maybe.
